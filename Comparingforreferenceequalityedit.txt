 Comparing Objects

<br>In Java, we can distinguish two kinds of equality.<br>
<br>Object reference equality: when two object references point to the same object.
Object value equality: when two separate objects happen to have the same values/state.
<br>If two objects are equal in reference, they are equal in value too.<br>
<br>
<br>The == operator can be used to check if two object references point to the same object.<br>
<br>
Code section 5.19: Reference equality.


1 if (objRef1 == objRef2) {
2     // The two object references point to the same object
3 }
