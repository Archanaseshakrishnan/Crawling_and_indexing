<br>Keywords are special tokens in the language which have reserved use in the language. Keywords may not be used as identifiers in Java — you cannot declare a field whose name is a keyword, for instance.<br>
<br>Examples of keywords are the primitive types, int and boolean; the control flow statements for and if; access modifiers such as public, and special words which mark the declaration and definition of Java classes, packages, and interfaces: class, package, interface.<br>
<br>Below are all the Java language keywords:<br>

<br>In addition, the identifiers null, true, and false denote literal values and may not be used to create identifiers.<br>

<br>abstract is a Java keyword. It can be applied to a class and methods. An abstract class cannot be directly instantiated. It must be placed before the variable type or the method return type. It is recommended to place it after the access modifier and after the static keyword. A non-abstract class is a concrete class. An abstract class cannot be final.<br>
<br>Only an abstract class can have abstract methods. An abstract method is only declared, not implemented:<br>
<br>
Code listing 1: AbstractClass.java


1 public abstract class AbstractClass {
2     // This method does not have a body; it is abstract.
3     public abstract void abstractMethod();
4  
5     // This method does have a body; it is implemented in the abstract class and gives a default behavior.
6     public void concreteMethod() {
7         System.out.println("Already coded.");
8     }
9 }


<br>An abstract method cannot be final, static nor native. Either you instantiate a concrete sub-class, either you instantiate the abstract class by implementing its abstract methods alongside a new statement:<br>
<br>
Code section 1: Abstract class use.


1 AbstractClass myInstance = new AbstractClass() {
2     public void abstractMethod() {
3         System.out.println("Implementation.");
4     }
5 };


<br>A private method cannot be abstract.<br>

<br>assert is a Java keyword used to define an assert statement. An assert statement is used to declare an expected boolean condition in a program. If the program is running with assertions enabled, then the condition is checked at runtime. If the condition is false, the Java runtime system throws an AssertionError.<br>
<br>Assertions may be declared using the following syntax:<br>
<br>



assert expression1 [: expression2];


<br>expression1 is a boolean that will throw the assertion if it is false. When it is thrown, the assertion error exception is created with the parameter expression2 (if applicable).<br>
<br>An example:<br>
<br>



assert list != null && list.size() > 0 : "list variable is null or empty";
Object value = list.get(0);


<br>Assertions are usually used as a debugging aid. They should not be used instead of validating arguments to public methods, or in place of a more precise runtime error exception.<br>
<br>Assertions are enabled with the Java -ea or -enableassertions runtime option. See your Java environment documentation for additional options for controlling assertions.<br>
