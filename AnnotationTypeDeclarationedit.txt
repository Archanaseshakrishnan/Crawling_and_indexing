Annotations can be viewed as a source of defining meta-data for a piece of code in Java. The annotation @CodeDescription used in the following sections does not come as a part of the Java API.<br>
<br>
<br>Before you can use an annotation with classes, theirs members and statements or expressions, you need to define an annotation type. Following is the syntax on how to define a type for the mentioned annotation.<br>
<br>
Code listing 1.1: Annotation type declaration


@interface CodeDescription
{
    String author();
    String version();
}


<br>That's it! Our first ever annotation has been defined. Now, we can use it with any of our classes. An annotation definition if you look closely resembles the definition of a normal interface, except that the interface keyword is preceded by the @ character. Some refer to this syntactical declaration as the annotation type declaration due to the fact that @ is 'AT' or 'Annotation Type' for that very instance.<br>
