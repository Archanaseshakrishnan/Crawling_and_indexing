<br>
There are five annotation types in the java.lang.annotation package called meta-annotations. These annotation types are used to annotate other annotation types.<br>
<br>
<br>If a member is annotated with a type itself marked as @Documented, then that member will be documented as annotating that type.<br>
<br>
Code listing 1.1: Use of @Documented


@interface Secret { }

@Documented
@interface NotSecret { }

@Secret
@NotSecret
public class Example {
}


<br>In the documentation for the Example class, such as the JavaDoc, Example will be shown as annotated with @NotSecret, but not @Secret.<br>
