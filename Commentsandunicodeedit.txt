 Coding conventions

<br>
A comment allows to insert text that will not be compiled nor interpreted. It can appear anywhere in the source code where whitespaces are allowed.<br>
<br>It is useful for explaining what the source code does by:<br>
<br>explaining the adopted technical choice: why this given algorithm and not another, why calling this given method...
explaining what should be done in the next steps (the TODO list): improvement, issue to fix...
giving the required explanation to understand the code and be able to update it yourself later or by other developers.
<br>It can also be used to make the compiler ignore a portion of code: temporary code for debugging, code under development...<br>
<br>
<br>The comments in Java use the same syntax as in C++.<br>
<br>An end-of-line comment starts with two slashes and ends with the end of the line. This syntax can be used on a single line too.<br>
<br>
Code section 3.105: Slash-slash comment.


1 // A comment to give an example
2 
3 int n = 10; // 10 articles


<br>A comment on several lines is framed with '/' + '*' and '*' + '/'.<br>
<br>
Code section 3.106: Slash-star comment in multiple lines.


 1 /*
 2  * This is a comment
 3  * on several lines.
 4  */
 5 
 6 /* This also works; slash-star comments may be on a single line. */
 7 
 8 /*
 9 Disable debugging code:
10 
11 int a = 10;
12 while (a-- > 0) System.out.println("DEBUG: tab["+a+"]=" + tab[a]);
13 */


<br>By convention, subsequent lines of slash-star comments begin with a star aligned under the star in the open comment sequence, but this is not required. Never nest a slash-star comment in another slash-star comment. If you accidentally nest such comments, you will probably get a syntax error from the compiler soon after the first star-slash sequence.<br>
<br>
Code section 3.107: Nested slash-star comment.


1 /* This comment appears to contain /* a nested comment. */
2  * The comment ends after the first star-slash and
3  * everything after the star-slash sequence is parsed
4  * as non-comment source.
5  */


<br>If you need to have the sequence */ inside a comment you can use html numeric entities: *&#47;.<br>
<br>Slash-star comments may also be placed between any Java tokens, though not recommended:<br>
<br>
Code section 3.108: Inline slash-star comment.


1 int i = /* maximum integer */ Integer.MAX_VALUE;


<br>However, comments are not parsed as comments when they occur in string literals.<br>
<br>
Code section 3.109: String literal.


1 String text = "/* This is not a comment. */";


<br>It results in a 33 character string.<br>

Question 3.26: Consider the following code:

Question 3.26: Commented code.

int a = 0;
// a = a + 1;
a = a + 1;
/*
a = a + 1;
*/
a = a + 1;
// /*
a = a + 1;
// */
a = a /*+ 1*/;
a = a + 1; // a = a + 1;
System.out.println("a=" + a);

What is printed in the standard output?

Answer


Output for Answer 3.26

a=4


Answer 3.26: Commented code.


 1 int a = 0;
 2 // a = a + 1;
 3 a = a + 1;
 4 /*
 5 a = a + 1;
 6 */
 7 a = a + 1;
 8 // /*
 9 a = a + 1;
10 // */
11 a = a /*+ 1*/;
12 a = a + 1; // a = a + 1;
13 System.out.println("a=" + a);



The highlighted lines are code lines but line 11 does nothing and only the first part of line 12 is code.



<br>
<br>
<br>Be aware that Java still interprets Unicode sequences within comments. For example, the Unicode sequence \u002a\u002f (whose codepoints correspond to */) is processed early in the Java compiler's lexical scanning of the source file, even before comments are processed, so this is a valid star-slash comment in Java:<br>
<br>
Code section 3.110: Unicode sequence interruption.


1 /* This is a comment. \u002a\u002f
2 String statement = "This is not a comment.";


<br>and is lexically equivalent to<br>
<br>
Code section 3.111: Unicode sequence interruption effect.


1 /* This is a comment. */
2 String statement = "This is not a comment.";


<br>(The '*' character is Unicode 002A and the '/' character is Unicode 002F.)<br>
<br>Similar caveats apply to newline characters in slash-slash comments.<br>
<br>For example:<br>
<br>
Code section 3.112: New line.


1 // This is a single line comment \u000a This is code


<br>That is because \u000a is Unicode for a new line, making the compiler think that you have added a new line when you haven't.<br>
